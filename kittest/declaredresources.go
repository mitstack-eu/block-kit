// CheckDeclaredResources drives each declared resource through its
// lifecycle and returns one problem per violation, empty when the block
// conforms. In order, it:
//
//   - observes each supplied resource once, which must be present;
//   - for each declared resource in manifest order, calls Ensure, Observe
//     (present), Ensure again and Observe again (present, with the same
//     outputs and secret outputs as the first), so a repeated ensure that
//     changes what Observe reports is caught;
//   - for each resource it ensured, in reverse manifest order, calls Delete
//     then Observe, which must report absent: the absence proof;
//   - observes each supplied resource again, which must still be present,
//     since a block never deletes what the app supplies.
//
// With DeclaredResources.Resource set, the creation pass and the teardown
// drive that one resource alone, under a Desired naming it, as the engine
// does for a request naming a resource; a name the manifest does not
// declare is one problem, and nothing is driven. A resource implementing
// handler.ReportingResource is ensured through EnsureWithReport, never
// Ensure, and a second ensure reporting a different identity from the first
// is a problem, since it means the ensure created another resource rather
// than converging the one it stored.
//
// A resource that fails stops the creation pass there, and a resource not
// proved absent stops the teardown there, so a resource created earlier is
// never deleted while a later one still stands. A missing handler, a
// handler for an undeclared resource, a manifest that is not
// mitstack/v1beta, one declaring no resources and one the parser refuses
// are each a problem, and nothing is driven. Each problem about a resource
// begins `resource "<name>": ` and each about a supplied resource begins
