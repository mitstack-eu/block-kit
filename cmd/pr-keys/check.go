// range and its own title both carry one — a merge commit or a rebase
// delivers the commits, and a squash delivers the title — so both halves
// are checked here, through the boardkeys package rather than a second
// regex.

// boardkeys.Message AND title delivers a key through boardkeys.Subject. An

// commits carries no delivery intent to check.
