# operator-kit

This module is the contract every mitstack block imports to talk to the
engine. It covers the webhook trust boundary a block's handler sits behind,
the events a block emits as it works, and `kittest`, the conformance harness
a block's own tests run against the same fixtures the engine is tested
against. The `contract` package owns the wire contract itself: the envelope
and response JSON schemas, the golden request and response fixtures both
sides are checked against, and the resource registry. The registry is the one
list of output names a block may declare in `spec.outputs` and read under
`spec.requires[].reads`, and the engine reads it from this package.

Resource types, and the kinds they implement, live in the platform's
catalogue and not in the kit. A block reads them from the type snapshot the
platform serves, which `contract.ParseTypeSnapshot` reads, as a later
section describes.

The `contract` package also owns the grammar of block, capability and
resource-type ids, which the platform's ADR 0080 sets. A community name is
bare, with no prefix, and mitstack assigns it. A private name sits under its
org's namespace, as in `@acme/billing-db`. Two orgs can then each hold a
private block named `api`, and a private name never takes a community one,
because no bare name is private. Each part is a slug of 1 to 40 lowercase
letters, digits and dashes that starts and ends with a letter or digit.
`contract.ParseBlockID` and `contract.ParseCapabilityID` accept `billing-db`
or `@acme/billing-db`, and `contract.ParseResourceTypeID` accepts
`aws.ebs-volume` or `@acme/aws.special-bucket`.

blockverify, the kit's conformance runner, judges a manifest's `metadata.id`
with `contract.ParseBlockID` in its manifest suite. Write a private id in
quotes, as in `id: "@acme/billing-db"`, because YAML does not allow `@` at
the start of an unquoted value.

[Running the block checks on your block](docs/block-checks.md) lists every
suite blockverify runs and the one command you run it with.

`contract.ParseManifest` is the kit's one block manifest parser for both
manifest versions, and blockverify and the handler read every manifest
through it. Under `mitstack/v1alpha` it reads the whole manifest strictly
into `contract.V1AlphaManifest`, every field the platform's decoder reads
and `spec.naming.appName`. Under `mitstack/v1beta` it reads the whole
manifest strictly into `contract.BlockManifest`. Under either version it
refuses any key those types do not name, naming the key's path. The kit ships the JSON Schema for `mitstack/v1beta` as
`contract/manifest.schema.json`, generated from the same types, and a contract
test fails when the committed file differs from what the types generate.
Regenerate it with
`go run ./cmd/manifest-schema > contract/manifest.schema.json`.

Under `mitstack/v1beta` a block names what it requires and what it creates by
exact type, as ADR 0085 sets. Each `requires` or `resources` entry is a type
id, or a mapping of `type`, `name` and, for a requirement, `many`. The `type`
is one id or a list of ids:

```yaml
requires:
  - github.repository
  - { name: host, type: [aws.ec2-instance, hetzner.server] }
resources:
  - aws.vpc
  - { name: deploy-role, type: aws.iam-role }
  - { name: app-container, type: [aws.ec2-container, hetzner.server-container] }
provides: [app-container, deploy-role]
```

`provides` lists the names of the resources the block offers to the rest of
the app. It replaces the capability slugs that older manifests list.

A block whose cloud credential is short-lived sets
`spec.lifecycle.needsCredentialRefresh: true`, read into
`ManifestLifecycle.NeedsCredentialRefresh`, to ask the platform to refresh
that credential before it expires. The field is optional and takes `true` or
`false` only, and a manifest without it reads as `false`.

To settle means the platform observes the state a block's last verb asked
for. A block whose install can outlast the platform's default settle wait sets
`spec.lifecycle.settleBudget`, read into `ManifestLifecycle.SettleBudget`, to
say how long the platform waits for it to settle. The field is optional and
takes a positive Go duration such as `75m`. The parser refuses zero, a
negative value or anything that is not a duration, naming the key, and a
manifest without it reads as zero.

An unnamed resource is named by its type id, and an unnamed requirement is
referenced by it. An entry that lists more than one type needs a name, and
two entries that would share a name or a reference are refused. The parser
refuses a key that is not a field of a `mitstack/v1beta` manifest, such as a
top-level `kind`, `spec.layer`, or `kind`, `in`, `on` or `inputs` on an
entry, naming its path. It judges the type id grammar only, so it needs no
type snapshot.

Whether the platform holds a type is a question for the type snapshot the
platform serves at `GET /v1/resource-types/snapshots/{version}`.
`contract.ParseTypeSnapshot` reads one, and `contract.CheckManifestTypes`
refuses an entry listing a type the snapshot does not hold.
`contract.CheckBinding` judges a binding a block's code reads, such as
`requires.host.outputs.hostId` or `resources.deploy-role.outputs.roleArn`. It
refuses a reference the block lacks, and an output that any listed type does
not declare in the snapshot.

A snapshot type may carry `"endsWithSubscription": true`, read into
`SnapshotType.EndsWithSubscription`, and a type without the field is
unmarked. The mark is for a resource whose absence cannot be observed, such
as a scaffold contribution's files in an app repository the platform keeps.
Such a resource ends when the block's unsubscribe succeeds.

A snapshot type may also list `parts`, read into `SnapshotType.Parts`. A
part is an object that exists only to serve one resource of the type, such
as the push role of an ECR repository. Each entry names the part's `type`,
a type id the same snapshot holds, and the `count`, the most objects of that
type one resource holds. `contract.ParseTypeSnapshot` refuses a part with no
type, a part whose type the snapshot does not hold, and a count below one. A
type without the field has no parts.

```json
{"id": "aws.ec2-instance", "parts": [{"type": "aws.iam-role", "count": 2}, {"type": "aws.iam-instance-profile", "count": 1}, {"type": "aws.elastic-ip", "count": 1}]}
```

`ManifestRequirement.Types` and `ManifestResource.Types` hold the listed ids,
and `ManifestResource.Type` holds the one id of an entry that lists one.
`ManifestResource.Inputs` and `On`, and `contract.InputValue`, are deprecated
and stay empty after a parse.

## Importing it

The module path is `github.com/mitstack-eu/operator-kit/v2`, since Go puts
the major version of a v2 or later release in the path. A block adds it the
usual way and imports its packages under that path, as in
`github.com/mitstack-eu/operator-kit/v2/handler`:

```
go get github.com/mitstack-eu/operator-kit/v2@vX.Y.Z
```

A block on a v1 release keeps working, because v2 changes the Go API and
leaves the wire contract alone. It moves to v2 on its next change.

The repository is private, so the fetch needs `GOPRIVATE=github.com/mitstack-eu`
in the environment and a credential able to read this repository (an SSH key
or a token configured for `github.com` in `~/.netrc` or `git config`).

## The typed contract

`contract.DecodeRequest` decodes a lifecycle webhook body into a
`contract.Request`, a Go struct whose JSON tags mirror envelope.schema.json
field for field. It also checks the schema's required set — operation,
nonce, createdAt, subscriptionId, blockId, orgId — and the operation enum,
so a malformed envelope fails with an error naming the JSON field before an
operator's own logic ever sees it, and when `cloudIdentity` or
`buildRequest` is present it checks their own required properties the same
way, naming them `cloudIdentity.provider` and similar. `contract.DecodeResponse`
does the same for a `contract.Response`, decoded against response.schema.json;
a field of the wrong type fails the same way, naming the field.

`Request.Identity()` returns a `contract.Identity`: the subset of a request
that names which subscription an operation targets and where its resource
lives — subscription, block, org, app, its resolved tool instances, its
prior outputs, and its cloud identity — independent of what it should
converge to. The instances belong here because a teardown has to address
the resource where it was provisioned: a block scoped to an AWS region
reads that region out of `Identity.Instances`. `Request.Desired()` returns a
`contract.Desired`, which embeds `Identity` and adds the params, secrets and
bindings that describe what an operator should converge its resource to, so
`d.Instances` resolves through the embedded `Identity` to the same map on
every verb. `Ensure`, `Observe` and `Delete` are each handed the verb's own
`Desired`, secrets included.

`contract.Observation` is what a validate or unsubscribe check found: a
`contract.State` (`Present`, `Absent`, or `Unknown`) plus whatever outputs
and status detail it gathered along the way. `Observation.Response()` turns
that into the `contract.Response` the webhook handler returns, mapping
`State` onto the response's `absent` pointer: `Present` sets it to `false`,
`Absent` sets it to `true`, and `Unknown` leaves it `nil` so the engine
fails open exactly as an operator that never implements the marker does.

## The Handler and Resource

A block implements `handler.Resource` — `Ensure`, `Observe`, `Delete` — and
`handler.New` wires it behind the trust boundary, the settle loop (a bounded
poll of `Observe` until the resource actually serves) and the
idempotency cache described below, calling whatever `Hooks` the block's
`Config` registers at `HookBeforeEnsure`, `HookAfterEnsure`, `HookBeforeDelete`
or `HookAfterDelete`.

A block declares its hooks in the manifest under `spec.lifecycle.hooks`, the
path held in the constant `contract.LifecycleHooksField`.
`contract.LifecycleHookPoints` is the closed set of names a block may declare
there. The handler and the platform's manifest validation both refuse a
name outside that set, and both refuse a name listed twice. Both sides test against
the same manifest golden, `contract.HooksManifestGolden`, so a change on
either side turns the other side's tests red. Its twin,
`contract.TypeBlockHooksManifestGolden`, is the same block written with
`type: block`, `format` and `store` and without a layer, and the handler
reads it exactly as it reads the first.

A request that carries no OBO token is refused with 401 on every verb —
subscribe, upgrade, validate, unsubscribe — before the Resource is ever
consulted. The token is the platform's own signed assertion of the
consuming org, app and subscription, and nothing in `Config` or the
manifest turns the check off.

An error the Resource or a hook returns is answered by its type. A
`*handler.Refused` answers 400 with a `refused:<class>` status detail,
which the engine treats as permanent. Any other error answers 500, which
the engine retries under the same idempotency key, and the idempotency
cache never stores a 500, so the retry reaches the Resource again. A panic
in the Resource or a hook is answered the same way as that second case: the
Handler recovers it and answers 500 with a fixed error naming the verb,
such as `handler: the block panicked during subscribe`. The response never
carries the panic value. The Handler recovers inside the idempotency cache's
single-flight call, so a delivery waiting on the same key receives that
same response rather than an empty one. The panic is logged with the block,
subscription and verb. A string or error panic value is logged with every
request secret scrubbed where it appears literally, and any other value is
logged only as its type, because formatting it could print a secret in a
form a literal scrub cannot find. A block cannot turn this recovery off.

The idempotency cache is keyed by subscription and by the request's
`idempotencyKey`, which the engine sets once per call and keeps the same
across every retry of that call. It stores only a settled answer, for an
hour: a settled 2xx or a 400 refusal is replayed to a later delivery of the
same key, and a delivery that overlaps one still in flight waits for it and
shares its answer. A 2xx that answers `pending:true` reaches the caller but
is never stored, because the engine re-drives the same key to learn when
the resource converges, and a stored pending answer would replay "still
pending" instead of observing it. An unsubscribe that answers
`absent:false` also reaches the caller but is never stored, because absence
must come from observing the resource, and the redelivery observes it
again. A subscribe or upgrade answer that carries `absent:false` is stored
as usual, since that is what a present resource answers. Two kinds of
request bypass the cache entirely: a validate, because it is a probe of the
resource's current state and a replayed observation could report a state
the resource has left, and any request whose `idempotencyKey` is empty.

`Resource` has one `Observe` and one `Delete`, and each receives the verb's
own `Desired`:

```go
type Resource interface {
	Ensure(ctx context.Context, d contract.Desired) error
	Observe(ctx context.Context, d contract.Desired) (contract.Observation, error)
	Delete(ctx context.Context, d contract.Desired) (outputs map[string]string, err error)
}
```

The Handler calls `Observe` once on validate, and on every settle poll a
subscribe, upgrade or unsubscribe drives, each time with that verb's
`Desired`, secrets included. A block whose resource sits behind a token reads
it there. The secrets reach `Observe` only for the duration of that one verb
call: the Handler stores them nowhere of its own, the idempotency cache
included, so a later, unrelated request never sees them.

`Delete` receives the unsubscribe request's full `Desired`, params and
secrets included. Returning an error from `Delete` aborts before anything is
destroyed: the Handler answers the error response immediately, with no
settle poll. The outputs `Delete` returns land in the unsubscribe response's
`outputs` once the block settles absent, and a block with nothing to hand
over returns none.

This is the shape the kit's own `handover` package exists for: a block reads
`d.Params["dataHandover"] == "snapshot"` to decide whether to snapshot data
before destroying it, and returns the resulting id under the key
`handover.OutputKey` ("dataSnapshotId") so it lands in the unsubscribe
response's `outputs`, alongside `absent:true`, once the resource settles
absent.

`Delete` must be idempotent. A settle timeout answers `absent:false` with no
outputs, and the platform's redrive calls `Delete` again, possibly after an
earlier call already destroyed the resource; a second call must find the
snapshot (or other handover artifact) it already made, or report the
resource gone, rather than fail. Its outputs also reach the wire unscrubbed,
the same way Observe's do, so they must never carry secret material.

### Retaining a resource on unsubscribe

A block whose manifest declares `spec.lifecycle.retainsOnUnsubscribe: true`
is one that by design keeps the resource it created — a consumer's own app
repository, say — so a normal teardown's `Observe` poll would just keep
reporting `Present` forever, since nothing ever destroys the resource to
make it go absent. Such a block declares `retainsOnUnsubscribe` so the
Handler settles its unsubscribe without ever probing for absence: as soon as
the `beforeDelete` hook, `Delete` and the `afterDelete` hook have all
succeeded, it answers `absent:true` at once, carrying any outputs `Delete`
returned, with a `statusDetail` explaining that the block declares it
retains its resource so absence was not observed. `Observe` is never called
for that unsubscribe.

A failed `Delete` or delete-side hook is unaffected by
the declaration: it still answers the ordinary error response, never
`absent:true`. A block that does not declare `retainsOnUnsubscribe` — the
field defaults to `false` — keeps the ordinary behaviour: the Handler polls
`Observe` up to `VerbBudget` times and answers `absent:false` if the budget
runs out still non-absent.

### The output-secret gate

Before any response leaves validate, a settled `Present` or a settled
`absent:true`, the Handler refuses one whose `Outputs` carry a value that
exactly matches one of the request's `secrets` values, over the merged
outputs of `Observe`, of each observer and of `Delete`. The refusal is a `*handler.Refused`
with `Class` `"secret-in-output"`, and its message names the offending
output key — never the value — so the refusal itself never becomes a second
leak.

The check is exact-value, not substring: an output that merely contains a
secret (an owner login embedded in a repository path, say) is left alone,
since scrubbing every occurrence would also mangle a legitimate output. This
is the gate's honest limit — it catches a secret returned verbatim as an
output value, and it cannot detect one embedded inside a longer value — so a
block must never put secret material in `Outputs`. Secret material belongs
in `SecretOutputs`, which the gate never inspects, since that field is where
a Resource is meant to return a secret on purpose. An empty secret value is
ignored: it names an unset optional secret rather than an actual one, and an
empty output value leaks nothing, so the two never combine into a false
refusal.

### Serving a block that declares its resources

A block whose `mitstack/v1beta` manifest lists its resources under
`spec.resources` creates and orders them itself, through its block-level
handler. That is the one `handler.Resource` the block's operator gives the
kit in `Config.Resource` to create, update and delete all its resources. The
operator also hands `handler.New` one `handler.Observer` per declared
resource in `Config.Observers`, keyed by the names the manifest gives:

```go
type Observer interface {
	ObserveResource(ctx context.Context, r contract.ResourceRef) (contract.Observation, error)
}
```

An observer asks the provider what stands right now, and never answers from
what an ensure remembered. Its `contract.ResourceRef` carries the resource's
name, the type it was created as, the identity that addresses it when that
is known, and the verb's `Desired`.

| Verb | What the Handler does |
|---|---|
| subscribe, upgrade | Runs one `Ensure`, then observes each declared resource in manifest order until it reports `Present` |
| unsubscribe | Runs one `Delete`, then observes each declared resource in reverse order until it reports `Absent`, skipping one whose type `Config.Types` marks `endsWithSubscription`, and merges the outputs `Delete` returned into the `absent:true` answer |
| validate | Observes each declared resource once, and names the resources an upgrade would replace |

A block-level handler that implements `handler.ResourceReporter` reports
what its ensure created, and the Handler calls `EnsureResources` in place of
`Ensure`. The shared observers find a resource only by the identity reported
here, so a block that uses them implements it:

```go
type ResourceReporter interface {
	EnsureResources(ctx context.Context, d contract.Desired) ([]contract.CreatedResource, error)
}

type CreatedResource struct {
	Name     string            // the manifest's name for the resource
	Type     string            // the exact type it was created as
	Identity map[string]string // the values that address it, such as {"instanceId": "i-0abc"}
}
```

Each observer is handed the identity and type reported for its resource.
When nothing was reported, it gets what the engine recorded under the
request's `recordedResources`, and failing that, no identity and the one
type its entry lists. A recorded type reaches the observer even when the
entry no longer lists it, since the resource was created as that type. A
reported resource the manifest does not declare, or of a type its entry does
not list, answers 400 quoting it. A handler that implements
`handler.ReplacementPlanner` names on validate the resources an upgrade would
replace, and the answer carries them under `replaces`.

Every observe is handed `Desired.VerbAt`, the time of the verb it settles,
and reads only what was made after it. After `Ensure` or `Delete` that is
the Handler's clock once the call returned. On a validate it is the request's
`settlesAt`, the time of the state-changing verb the validate settles, and
otherwise the request's `createdAt`. A validate request and its answer look
like this:

```json
{"operation": "validate", "settlesAt": "2026-10-07T12:00:00Z",
 "recordedResources": {"aws.ebs-volume": {"type": "aws.ebs-volume", "identity": {"volumeId": "vol-0abc"}}}}
```

```json
{"outputs": null, "absent": false, "replaces": ["aws.ebs-volume"],
 "resources": {"aws.ebs-volume": {"observe": {"state": "present", "type": "aws.ebs-volume", "identity": {"volumeId": "vol-0abc"}}}}}
```

The answer's `resources` map holds an `observe` entry per resource with its
state, outputs, identity and `type`. The top-level `outputs` and
`secretOutputs` are the union of the resources `spec.provides` names.

In that union a later resource wins a key two resources share, so two
`aws.iam-role` resources would lose one `roleArn`. The answer therefore also
carries `resourceSecretOutputs`, which maps each provided resource's name to
its own secret outputs:

```json
{"resourceSecretOutputs": {
  "deploy-role": {"roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/deploy"},
  "ecr-push-role": {"roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/ecr-push"}}}
```

A resource with no secret output has no entry there. No secret output ever
appears in `resources`, because the engine records that map.

A pending answer still carries `secretOutputs` and `resourceSecretOutputs`
for each provided resource the verb already observed present. The platform
stores them once it confirms the remaining resources itself, such as a
hostname it reads from its own zone.

A resource not present within the verb budget answers `pending:true` naming
it, and unsubscribe answers `absent:true` only when every resource observes absent.
The exception is a resource whose type `Config.Types` marks
`endsWithSubscription`. The Handler counts it absent once the delete
succeeds and never observes it, so its entry carries a `delete` outcome of
state `absent` and no `observe`:

```json
{"absent": true,
 "resources": {"github.scaffold-contribution": {"delete": {"state": "absent", "type": "github.scaffold-contribution",
   "identity": {"repository": "acme/weather"},
   "statusDetail": "type github.scaffold-contribution ends with its subscription, so the resource is absent once the delete succeeds, unobserved"}}}}
```

A failed delete still answers the ordinary error, and a block given no
`Config.Types`, or a snapshot leaving the type unmarked, observes the
resource as any other. A block passes `Config.Types` the snapshot its
manifest is judged against.

The Handler checks the request's context before it observes each resource.
Once the context is done, the verb stops before that resource and names it
in `statusDetail`. Subscribe, upgrade and validate then answer
`pending:true`, and unsubscribe answers `absent:false`. Every answer, an
error included, carries in its `resources` map only the resources the verb
reached. Each entry's `error` and `statusDetail` are scrubbed of the
request's secrets, and each entry's `outputs` pass the output-secret gate
above. A block served over a single `Resource` reports no `resources` map.

A request naming one resource is served for validate alone, observing that
resource with the request's `resourceIdentity` and `resourceType`. A named
subscribe, upgrade or unsubscribe answers 400. The request's
`requirementTypes` say which exact type met each requirement.

A validate can name a resource that an earlier version declared and the
current manifest no longer does. `Config.TypeObservers` serves that case. It
holds observers keyed by resource-type id, and the Handler hands the request's
`resourceType` and `resourceIdentity` to the observer filed under that type. A
name the manifest does not declare and no type observer holds answers 400,
quoting the resource and its type. So does a named subscribe, upgrade or
unsubscribe.

`handler.New` refuses a declared resource with no observer, an observer the
manifest does not declare, and `Observers` without a `mitstack/v1beta`
manifest. It refuses `TypeObservers` on the same
two grounds, and also refuses a key that is not a resource-type id. The trust
boundary, idempotency, secret scrubbing, events and error classes work as for any other block.

The `observe` package holds the kit's shared observers, one per type, each
over a small API interface the operator implements. They include
`EC2Instance`, `EgressProxy`, `S3Bucket`, `VPC`, `SecurityGroup`, `EBSVolume`,
`ECRRepository`, `IAMRole`, `Route53Record`, `SSMAssociation`, `EC2Container`,
`EC2PostgresDatabase`, `HetznerServer`, `HetznerPrimaryIP`, `HetznerFirewall`,
`HetznerNetwork`, `GitHubRepository`, `GitHubCommit`, and `NodeReported`. A
host probe never reads a failed probe as absence: `HostCommander` returns a
nonzero exit as an error, and empty output is unknown.

`EC2PostgresDatabase` probes the Postgres container postgres-db runs for
each subscription, named by the identity's `instanceId` and `container`, the
way postgres-db does. Its probe prints `PRESENT=1`, `PRESENT=0` when Docker
answers without the container, or `PRESENT=unknown` when Docker does not
answer, and then for a present container `READY=` and `pg_isready`'s exit
status. The container is present once `READY=0`, absent on `PRESENT=0`, and
otherwise unknown. It reports `dbName` only when the identity carries
`database`. `EC2PostgresDatabase` and `NodeReported` report presence and
identity only, so a block that provides such a resource reports the type's
other required outputs from its own observer.

`NodeReported` serves a resource the platform has no route to, such as a
`kubernetes.namespace`, from node reports. A node report is the report a
node of the Hetzner cluster sends the platform, read at
`GET /v1/subscriptions/{id}/node-reports`. Reports are stored under the
cluster's own subscription, so the identity names it as
`clusterSubscription`, beside the object's `kind`, `name` and optional
`namespace`; without it, `NodeReported` reads the observing subscription's
own reports. An object matches only when it also carries the observing
subscription's id, since an object is labelled by the subscription that
created it. A report's body lists those objects under
`subscriptionResources`, and may carry
`madeAt` and `subscriptionResourcesComplete`. A report counts when its
`madeAt`, or its receipt time when it has none, is after `VerbAt`, and the
newest counting report decides. An object it lists is present. An object it
does not list is absent only when the report carries a `madeAt` after
`VerbAt` and `subscriptionResourcesComplete: true`. Otherwise it is unknown.

`observe.AWSTagged` and `observe.HetznerLabelled` list everything carrying a
subscription's id, under the AWS tag `mitstack:subscription`
(`observe.AWSSubscriptionTag`) or the Hetzner label
`mitstack.dev/subscription` (`observe.HetznerSubscriptionLabel`).
`observe.AWSTagged` names each object by its type id. An instance
profile, an Elastic IP, a security group rule, a DLM lifecycle policy and an
SSM document read as `aws.iam-instance-profile`, `aws.elastic-ip`,
`aws.security-group-rule`, `aws.dlm-lifecycle-policy` and `aws.ssm-document`.

`observe.GitHubTagged` lists what a subscription holds on GitHub, over the
`observe.GitHubTagAPI` interface that a block's client or its fake GitHub
serves. A repository counts when it carries the topic
`observe.GitHubSubscriptionTopic` gives, which for `sub_3e304e324312` is
`mitstack-sub-3e304e324312`. On such a repository, the lister also reports
every webhook, each Actions secret and variable under a name the block lists
in `Secrets` or `Variables`, and what each commit closing with the trailer
`observe.GitHubSubscriptionTrailer` gives wrote. On a repository that the
block's `github.repository` or `github.gitops-repository` requirement binds,
it reports the same, except that a webhook counts only when it points at
`ProcessorURL`, and the repository itself counts only when it carries the
topic. A committed file
counts as a `github.workflow-file`, unless the block sets `CommitType`, which
makes a repository's trailer commits count once as that type, while the
branch still holds a path they wrote.
`kittest.ListerProvider` serves such a lister to `kittest.AssertBlock`. The
tagging guard then hands the lister the `contract.Desired` it holds, which
carries the requirement bindings, and `Provider` itself does not change.

A block proves its guards in its own tests with `kittest.AssertBlock`. It
takes a `kittest.Block`: the manifest, the type snapshot, the block-level
handler, the observers, a `kittest.Provider` and the subscription. It serves
the block through `handler.New` and signed requests, so it holds the block
to the Handler's own rules. After subscribe, every declared resource must
observe present with an identity, and every provided one with the outputs
its type marks required. Everything the provider lists under the
subscription's id must match, by type and count, a declared resource or a
part that a declared resource's type lists in the snapshot. The check pools
the room per part type: it adds up the parts of one type across every
recorded resource, including two entries naming that type in one list, and
does not tie a part to the resource that owns it. A resource the provider
loses must then observe not present. With `Upgrade` set, a resource the
upgrade replaces must be named in the `replaces` of the validate before it, and
the problem says so when its type is stateful.
`Upgrade` nil while a declared type is stateful is a problem. After
unsubscribe every declared resource must observe absent, except one whose
type the snapshot marks `endsWithSubscription`, since the check serves the
handler with `Config.Types` set to that snapshot. A requirement
listing more than one type runs the check once per listed type, with
`Requirements` giving each type's outputs, and each problem names the type.
`AssertBlock` logs which guards ran. blockverify's resources suite requires
a `TestDeclaredResources` test that calls `kittest.AssertBlock`, runs it, and
names in its pass detail the guards that ran.

### Serving a capability and issuing an app's credential

A `mitstack/v1beta` manifest's `type` is `block` or `capability`. A capability
is a unit that serves more than one app, such as a shared cluster or an org's
payment provider. The Handler serves its four lifecycle verbs exactly as it
serves a block's, so a capability that apps reach through their own blocks
needs nothing more.

A capability may also give each app a credential narrowed to that app, such as
a one-hour access token. Its block-level handler then implements
`handler.CredentialIssuer`:

```go
type CredentialIssuer interface {
	IssueCredential(ctx context.Context, d contract.Desired, appID string) (contract.Credential, error)
}
```

The platform asks for one app's credential with the `issue` operation, a
signed request to `/hook` that names the app under `issueAppId`. The Handler
calls `IssueCredential` and answers 200 with the credential under
`credential`, as in
`{"outputs":null,"credential":{"values":{"accessToken":"tok-1"},"expiresAt":"2026-10-14T13:00:00Z"}}`.
It answers every issue afresh, because a replayed credential may have
expired, and it emits no lifecycle event for one.

The Handler refuses an issue it cannot answer safely:

| Case | Answer |
|---|---|
| The manifest's type is `block` | 400, refusal class `not-a-capability` |
| The capability implements no `CredentialIssuer` | 400, refusal class `issues-no-credential` |
| The request names no app under `issueAppId` | 400 |
| The credential holds no value or has no expiry | 500 |
| A credential value equals a secret the request carried | 500, naming the key and never the value |

The last row refuses a credential value equal to a secret the request
carried, such as the org's connection key passed in `secretInputs`. It
compares whole values only. A value derived from a secret, or a credential the
capability holds in its own configuration, passes it, so the capability's own
code is what keeps such a credential from an app.

### Deploying a declared resource through GitOps

The `gitops` package serves a declared resource that deploys through Argo CD,
the controller on the cluster that applies whatever the GitOps repository
holds. A block-level handler commits the block's rendered manifests to that
repository and waits for Argo CD through `gitops.Deploy`, and a
`gitops.Resource` observes each such resource as its `handler.Observer`,
judging the deploy from Argo CD's notification, which the platform relays.
The Handler serves a validate naming the resource through that observer.

You give a `gitops.Resource` three functions: one returns the
`gitops.Repository` the resource lives in, one returns its notification source
and one renders its files. `gitops.NotificationsFromContext` builds that
source from the events callback on the request. The events callback is the URL
and token the platform puts in every lifecycle request, and the package reuses
them to read the notifications the platform relayed.

```go
resource := &gitops.Resource{
	Repository: func(ctx context.Context, d contract.Desired) (gitops.Repository, error) {
		return repoFor(ctx, d)
	},
	Notifications: func(ctx context.Context, _ contract.Desired) (gitops.Notifications, error) {
		return gitops.NotificationsFromContext(ctx)
	},
	Render: renderNamespace,
}
```

`ObserveResource` renders from the request its `contract.ResourceRef`
carries, so it judges the files the block's handler committed for that
request.

`gitops.CommitManifests`, and `gitops.Deploy` through it, refuses a file that
carries any of the request's secrets, verbatim or base64-encoded on its own,
with `gitops.ErrSecretInManifest` before anything is written. That check is a
backstop. A secret encoded inside a larger value,
such as the token in a `.dockerconfigjson` auth field, passes it. So does a
secret in raw or URL-safe base64, or in any other encoding. A block
therefore never renders secret material, and a secret reaches a slice through
External Secrets instead (platform ADR 0072).

Its observe reads the app's newest notification, whatever revision it names,
and judges it only when the files at that revision match the render. Say the
handler committed revision `a1b2` and the newest notification names a later
commit `c3d4`: observe reads the files at `c3d4`, finds the rendered files
there, and lets the sync of `c3d4` decide the deploy. It works this way
because Argo CD may sync a later revision than the one committed, so the
notification for a change can name a later commit. A live sync on a scratch
cluster with two commits inside one poll interval would show whether that
happens, and it has not been observed yet. A revision whose sync reports phase
`Succeeded` and health `Healthy` is deployed, while the sync status and the
images are never read.

Observe answers unknown in three more cases. The first is when head holds the
rendered files only in part, or with other content. The second is when Argo CD
has reported no deploy of the app yet. The third is when the newest
notification names a revision that does not yet carry the change at head. A
resource that was never committed is therefore absent only in an empty
repository. In a repository that holds other apps' commits, it stays unknown
until Argo CD reports on the app. A sync in phase `Error` or `Failed`, or with
health `Degraded`, makes observe return an error carrying the phase, the
health and the message.

`gitops.Check` and `gitops.Wait` take the other approach and judge only the
notification for the exact revision you hand them. Use them when you need the
outcome of one particular commit, since a notification for any other revision
leaves them pending. `Wait` polls until the deploy succeeds or fails, and a
failed deploy is an outcome rather than an error.

A block-level handler ships its whole desired state with `gitops.Deploy`. It
takes a `gitops.BlockDeploy` holding the app, every file, the commit message,
the request's secret values and the poll interval. It commits every file once
through `CommitManifests` and waits on that revision, or on head when nothing
changed. The `gitops.Deployed` it returns carries the revision, whether it
committed, and Argo CD's verdict, so a failed sync comes back in
`Deployed.Outcome` for the block to refuse:

```go
func (b *block) Ensure(ctx context.Context, d contract.Desired) error {
	out, err := gitops.Deploy(ctx, b.repo, b.notes, gitops.BlockDeploy{
		App:     d.AppID,
		Files:   render(d),
		Message: "deploy " + d.AppID,
		Secrets: gitops.SecretValues(d),
		Poll:    5 * time.Second,
	})
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if out.Outcome.Verdict == gitops.VerdictFailed {
		return handler.Refuse("deploy-failed", "Argo CD's sync of %s failed: %s", out.Revision, out.Outcome.Notification.Message)
	}
	return nil
}
```

The block's `Delete` ships the removal the same way, handing `Deploy` each
rendered path with no content. Paths already gone commit nothing, so
deleting what was never created succeeds. `gitops.Revert` restores every
path one revision changed to its content at that revision's parent.

The platform answers a block only the notifications of the cluster its
`kubernetes-cluster` requirement binds, within the block's own org. A block
whose requirement binds no cluster, or several, reads none, so its observe
answers unknown. A cluster that hosts apps of several orgs needs a scoping
rule of its own, which the platform does not provide. A notification looks
like this:

```json
{"app":"app-alpha","project":"app-alpha","sync":"Synced","revision":"9ee9b7e28c000b16a89b7b717e5f3b9fa6fcf611","health":"Healthy","phase":"Succeeded","message":"successfully synced (all tasks run)","images":null,"reconciledAt":"2026-09-28T10:47:23Z"}
```

`gitops.NewGitHubRepository` gives the kit's implementation of
`gitops.Repository` over GitHub, and it commits to the repository's `main`. It
takes the API base from the request's `github` instance, resolved through
`ghapi.BaseFromEnv`, and the token from the request's `github` secret. Apart from
the empty revision `""`, every revision it reads at or commits on must be a
full lowercase hex SHA of 40 or 64 digits, and anything else is refused before
a request goes out. File content
must be UTF-8, because the Git Data API carries it as a JSON string. A commit
whose parent is no longer the tip lands nothing, so `CommitManifests` and
`Revert` retry it on a fresh head a bounded number of times. In tests, `gitopstest.NewRepository`
and `gitopstest.NewNotifications` give in-memory fakes of both.

### Building an SSM host

An operator that runs scripts on an EC2 instance through AWS Systems Manager
(SSM) builds its host with `hostexec.SSMHost`. The kind it passes is the
`execKind` its app-host binding gives it. `SSMHost` accepts only the `aws-ssm`
kind and refuses any other with an error that matches `hostexec.ErrNotSSM` and
repeats nothing from the host.

`SSMHost` takes the target, credential and region as adjacent strings, so a
caller passes them in that order, and a block that sets no credential passes
`""`. The target and region are left for `hostexec.Run` to judge.

### Driving a CloudFormation stack

An operator names its CloudFormation stack with `awsnames.StackName`, which
prefixes `mitstack-` to the id, turns every character outside the ASCII letters
and digits `[A-Za-z0-9]` into a dash through `awsnames.SanitiseCFNName`, and
cuts the result to CloudFormation's limit of 128 characters.

The operator drives the stack through `cfnstack.New`. It writes a short adapter
from its own AWS SDK client to `cfnstack.Client`, which keeps the kit free of
any dependency outside the standard library. `EnsureStack` creates the stack
and updates it instead when the create fails with an error whose `ErrorCode()`
is `AlreadyExistsException`, which the SDK's typed exception satisfies. An
update with nothing to change succeeds, and so does deleting a stack that does
not exist.

### Writing an app's hostname record

An AWS host operator points the app's name in the platform's apps zone at the
box's Elastic IP, and deletes that record when the app unsubscribes. The
`appsdns` package holds this one record for every such operator. You build an
`appsdns.Zone` from the zone's name, its hosted zone ID and a client, and the
operator writes a short adapter from its AWS SDK Route 53 client to
`appsdns.Client`, as it does for `cfnstack`.

`Zone.Hostname("myapp")` returns `myapp.apps.mitstack.dev` for the zone
`apps.mitstack.dev`, and an empty string when the zone, its ID or the app name
is missing. `Zone.Publish` upserts the A record with a TTL of 60 seconds,
because a replaced box gets a new address and a stale answer would point at
the old one.

`Zone.Retire` reads the record and deletes it with the TTL and values it
holds, since Route 53 refuses a delete that does not match them exactly. A
refused delete returns the client's error, so a teardown fails instead of
leaving a name that points at a released address. A record that is already
gone, before the delete or by the time it runs, counts as deleted.

`Zone` is also the observer for the `mitstack.app-hostname` resource. It reads
only Route 53 and reports the record present with its `appHostname`, `address`
and `appUrl` outputs, absent when the zone holds no such record, and unknown
when the zone is not configured or the read fails.

## Testing

```
go vet ./... && go test ./...
```

The module is stdlib-only by design: no third-party dependency has ever been
needed, and none is added.

### Reading a manifest in a test

`kittest.ReadManifest` parses a block manifest file through
`contract.ParseManifest` and fails the test, naming the path, when the file
cannot be read or the parser refuses it. The `kittest.Manifest` it returns
embeds the parsed `contract.Manifest`, so `ID()`, `Version()`, `Block` and
`V1Alpha` stay reachable.

`Section` reads a value by dotted key path, such as `spec.lifecycle` or
`spec.lifecycle.verbBudgets.subscribe`. Each segment is a manifest key: the
json tag on the `mitstack/v1beta` types or the yaml tag on the
`mitstack/v1alpha` types. It returns the field's typed Go value, so
`spec.resources` under v1beta is a `[]contract.ManifestResource`, and it
returns false for a key the manifest leaves unset. A key the types do not
name, or a key below a scalar, fails the test rather than reading as unset.

`SpecScalar` reads `spec.<key>` as text, trimmed, so a folded `>` description
reads as one line. It renders a boolean or an integer with `fmt.Sprint`,
reads a blank string as unset, and fails the test when the key is a section.

```go
m := kittest.ReadManifest(t, "manifest.yaml")
lifecycle, ok := m.Section("spec.lifecycle")
description, ok := m.SpecScalar("description")
```

### Running a workflow script in a test

A test that matches text in a rendered workflow passes over a shell error
inside a `run:` block, so `kittest` runs the script instead.
`kittest.ReadWorkflowScript` takes the rendered YAML, a job key under
`jobs:` and the `name:` of one entry in that job's list, and returns the
entry's `run:` body and `env`. `kittest.RunWorkflowScript` runs that body
under `bash -euo pipefail`, which is stricter than the `bash -e` GitHub uses
by default, and returns its exit code, stdout and stderr.

The body sees no environment from the test process. Its `PATH` holds only
the fakes the test writes and the real tools it names, so a command the test
did not supply exits 127. Its environment is the entry's `env` with the
test's own `Env` laid over it.

The helper reads no `if:` and evaluates no `${{ }}` expression. A test that
cares about the output of an entry that was skipped sets that output to the
empty string itself, and a test substitutes any expression in the body
before the run. Because the kit is stdlib-only, the reader understands block
mappings and sequences, single-line plain and quoted scalars, and `|`
literal blocks. It returns an error naming the line for any other shape,
such as a folded `>` body, a flow mapping, an alias, a YAML null, a key
given twice or a `shell:` other than `bash`, rather than guess at it.

```go
script, err := kittest.ReadWorkflowScript(rendered, "release", "Cut the tag")
if err != nil {
	t.Fatal(err)
}
res := kittest.RunWorkflowScript(t, script, kittest.ScriptRun{
	Fakes: map[string]string{"gh": `echo "gh $*"`},
	Tools: []string{"git"},
	Env:   map[string]string{"VERSION": "1.2.3"},
})
if res.ExitCode != 0 {
	t.Fatalf("script exited %d: %s", res.ExitCode, res.Stderr)
}
```

### Proving no secret leaks

`kittest.AssertNoSecretLeak` drives an operator's own handler with signed
webhook requests that carry seeded secrets. It fails the test for each place
a secret or an OBO token shows up: a `/hook` response, the standard logger's
output, or a line `GET /logs` serves. The OBO token is the on-behalf-of token
the platform signs for each request. `kittest.CheckNoSecretLeak` does the
same work without a `*testing.T` and returns the problems as strings. A
problem names the channel and shows a secret only in redacted form.

Seed each secret wherever the operator reads it: under `secrets`, as a
secret param, or as a secret resource input. Mark a request `Fails` when the
operator's verb answers it with an error, so that the verb's error path runs
and its error text is checked too.

The harness signs each request and adds a fresh `nonce`, `createdAt`, an
`idempotencyKey` when the body has none, and an OBO token for the body's
`orgId` and `subscriptionId`. It also reports a fixture whose passing would
prove nothing. A seeded secret that is empty or in no request body is a
problem. So is a fixture with no request marked `Fails`, and a `Fails`
request that answers below 400. A body the kit's envelope decoder refuses is
a problem, since no verb ran, and it drives no error path. A `/hook` that
answers 401 is a problem too, since the handler did not trust the harness's
signer and no verb ran. A `Serve` that replaces the standard logger's writer
is a problem, since the log output check would then read nothing. A
`GET /logs` that answers other than 200 or serves no lines is the last.

In the example below, `newHandler` is the operator's own constructor, taking
the JWKS URL and the `/logs` buffer, and `apiToken` is the seeded secret. The
kid and seed given to `kittest.NewSigner` only make the signing key
deterministic.

```go
func TestNoSecretLeak_LogsEndpoint(t *testing.T) {
	kittest.AssertNoSecretLeak(t, kittest.SecretLeak{
		Secrets: []string{apiToken},
		Serve: func(logs *webhook.LogBuffer) (http.Handler, *kittest.Signer) {
			signer := kittest.NewSigner(t, "sample-kid", 3)
			h, err := newHandler(signer.JWKSServer(t), logs)
			if err != nil {
				t.Fatalf("newHandler: %v", err)
			}
			return h, signer
		},
		Requests: []kittest.LeakRequest{{
			Name: "subscribe whose Ensure quotes the API token",
			Body: map[string]any{
				"operation":      "subscribe",
				"subscriptionId": "sub-1",
				"blockId":        "secretleak-sample",
				"orgId":          "org-1",
				"secrets":        map[string]any{"api": map[string]any{"token": apiToken}},
			},
			Fails: true,
		}},
	})
}
```

While it runs, the harness redirects the standard logger into its own
capture, the `/logs` buffer it hands to `Serve`, and the writer the standard
logger had before the call. It restores that writer when it returns. The
test must therefore not run in parallel with a test that logs.

## Release

Every push to main that changes the tree cuts the next patch tag
(`scripts/release-operator-kit.sh`, run from CI). A commit message carrying a
`kit-release: minor` or `kit-release: major` line raises that level instead,
and each raise zeroes the levels below it. A skipped or failed release run is
not lost: the next push resolves the base from the newest tag and cuts the
release the earlier push owed.

A change that breaks the Go API takes `kit-release: major`. Go requires the
module path to end in the major version from v2 on, so the same change moves
the module path, now `/v2`, to the next major and every import with it.

## Recording a delivery on the board

Every push to main also records which board issues it delivered, through
`cmd/board-delivery`. The `boardkeys` package derives the keys a commit
delivers: a key counts only when it sits in a leading key list in the
commit's subject, terminated by a colon, or in a whole-line `Jira:` trailer
in the body. A key anywhere else in a subject, or in an ordinary body line,
is prose and delivers nothing.

`board-delivery` reads a local `board-synced` git tag as the anchor for its
range: the commits since that tag, or since the push event's `before` sha
when no tag exists yet, or the single pushed commit when neither is usable.
It posts the derived keys to the board's `/v1/delivered` endpoint once, and
only after that write succeeds does it move the `board-synced` tag to the
pushed commit and push it, so the next run picks up exactly where this one
left off. A push whose commits deliver no keys records nothing and still
succeeds. A push with keys but no `TRACKER_BASE_URL` configured fails the
run, since a delivery that silently skips the board looks the same as one
that reached it.

## Gating a pull request on a board key

Every pull request also runs `cmd/pr-keys`, which fails the `pr-key-gate`
check when neither its commits nor its own title carries a board key. Both
halves are checked because either can be the one that reaches main: a merge
commit or a rebase delivers the range's commits, while a squash delivers
only the pull request's title, folding every commit into that one line. A
key has to lead a commit subject's key list (`MIT-123: fix the thing`) or
sit on its own `Jira:` trailer line, and the same leading-list rule applies
to the title — a key that only appears inside a merge commit's default
branch name is not delivery intent, and the gate does not count it.

## Judging the comments in a pull request

`cmd/commentcheck` judges the Go and TypeScript comments a pull request adds,
comparing the working tree with the pull request's base commit. This
repository's `comment check` job runs it on every pull request. For a block,
`publish-block.yml` runs it in the conformance job once the block pins a kit
release that carries the command.

The check fails when an added comment holds a ticket id, which is `MIT-` or
`MS-` followed by digits, or a `file:line` reference. A comment says what the
code does, and the ticket belongs in the commit subject.

A file's comment share is the fraction of its lines that are comment lines,
meaning lines whose first non-blank character lies inside a comment. The check
also fails when a file the pull request adds, changes or renames holds a share
above its target, whatever the file held at the base. The target is 7% for a
production file and 6% for a test file, where a test file is a `_test.go` file,
a `.test` or `.spec` TypeScript file, or anything under `__tests__`. A file the
pull request leaves alone is not judged, nor is a deleted or generated file.

You can run the check before you push, against the commit your branch started
from:

```sh
base="$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)"
go run ./cmd/commentcheck -base "$base" .
go run ./cmd/commentcheck -base "$base" -same-code .
go run ./cmd/commentcheck -report cmd/commentcheck
```

The second command proves a change only removes or rewrites comments, and it
fails naming any file whose code differs from the base. The third prints the
comment share of a file or directory and needs no base. The check reads the
working tree as the head, so a file you moved without `git mv` is judged as a
new file until you stage the move.
