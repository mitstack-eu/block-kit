// Package handler serves the four lifecycle verbs — subscribe, upgrade,
// validate, unsubscribe — over a block author's Resource, so a block author
// never reimplements (or quietly omits) the invariants that make an operator
// safe to run: the mitstack trust boundary, idempotent replay, the settle
// loop that waits for a resource to actually converge, the absent marker,
// and the error classification a refused teardown depends on (MIT-2659).
//
// A block author supplies a Resource and, optionally, Hooks declared in the
// block's own manifest.yaml. Every other invariant — idempotency, the settle
// budget, the absent marker, the error classes — belongs to the Handler, not
// to a knob a block can override. A hook the manifest declares but that
// nothing registers is accepted by New and simply never called.
//
// A block whose mitstack/v1beta manifest declares its resources supplies a
// DeclaredResource for each one instead, under Config.Resources. The
// Handler then runs each verb resource by resource in the manifest's
// creation order, tearing down in reverse, and reports each resource's
// calls by name in the response's resources map. A request that names one
// declared resource runs the verb on that resource alone.
